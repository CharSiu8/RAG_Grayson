## Overview

**GRAYSON** is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot I made for my brother in law who is currently doing a PhD. It is focused exclusively on **theology, philosophy, and biblical studies**. It helps researchers, students, and enthusiasts quickly locate and understand academic resources in these fields.

### The Problem

Researchers and students waste hours searching fragmented databases for theology and philosophy papers. University libraries are often outdated, and finding relevant academic sources across multiple platforms is tedious. My brother in law was also frustrated with not being able to find resources that are referenced by LLMS in his primary libraries, OMNI and JSTOR

### The Solution

GRAYSON centralizes semantic search across theology and philosophy resources, providing:
- Instant access to relevant academic papers
- AI-generated summaries with source citations
- Direct links to OMNI and JSTOR for full-text access
- "Have you considered?" suggestions for related research directions

## Features

- **Theology-Focused Search**: Automatically filters results to philosophy, theology, religion, and biblical studies
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings to find conceptually related papers, not just keyword matches
- **Source Citations**: Every response includes clickable links to original sources
- **Library Integration**: Provides direct search links to OMNI and JSTOR
- **Free PDF Finder**: Automatically searches Unpaywall and Semantic Scholar for open access PDFs of cited sources
- **"Have You Considered?"**: Suggests related topics to explore after each query
- **Simple Web UI**: Clean chat interface for easy interaction
- **/feedback**: Users can provide feedback about their interactions. these messages are webhooked to my Discord

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key (optional - works without it using placeholder responses)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharSiu8/GRAYSON.git
cd GRAYSON
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key (optional)
```

5. Start the backend:
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

6. Open the frontend:
```
Open frontend/index.html in your browser
```

## Usage

### Ingest Papers

Before querying, ingest some theology papers:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Gospel of John", "max_results": 10}'
```

### Query

Ask a question:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the theological significance of John 1:1?"}'
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the research... **Have you considered?** ...",
  "sources": [
    {"title": "Paper Title", "doi": "https://doi.org/...", "year": 2020, "free_pdf": "https://..."}
  ],
  "library_links": {
    "omni": "https://omni.scholarsportal.info/search?q=...",
    "jstor": "https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=..."
  }
}
```

Note: `free_pdf` is included when an open access version is found via Unpaywall or Semantic Scholar.
